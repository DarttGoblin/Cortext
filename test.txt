Hey Brenner, it’s me again. I just…miss you.

The last game wasn’t the same without you. Tony was stumbling, Coach benched him, and everyone laughed, but all I could think of was you. I remembered when we first met, back in the flower shop, and later when you joined the team. You always gave everything—gentle, steady, and kind.

I can still see you catching that game-winning pass in the rain, mud everywhere, the crowd screaming. You smiled at me afterward, told me it was okay, told me I didn’t need to be perfect. That smile… it carried me through so many bad days.

But now you’re gone. And the field feels empty. My chest feels hollow. I wish I could tell you how much you meant to me. I wish I had one more game, one more laugh, one more hug. You were a good friend. You always were. And I’ll never stop missing you.
