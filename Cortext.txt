Data Loading: We load the data into the model.

Backend-Frontend Connection: We use Flask to create a connection between the frontend and backend.

Pipeline Usage: We use the machine learning pipeline provided by libraries like sklearn to guide the preprocessing of the data from collection to prediction, ensuring reproducibility and reducing errors.

Algorithm Choice: The algorithm chosen is Support Vector Machine (SVM), which is effective for binary classification tasks.

Hyperplane: The hyperplane is the decision boundary that separates the classes. In 2D, it's a line; in 3D, it's a plane; and in higher dimensions, it's referred to as a hyperplane.

Margins and Support Vectors:

Margins refer to the distance between the hyperplane and the data points from each class.
Support vectors are the data points that lie closest to the hyperplane and are critical in defining the position of the hyperplane.
Why SVM? Advantages:

Effective in high-dimensional spaces.
Works well with a clear margin of separation.
Robust to overfitting, especially with a proper choice of kernel.
Challenges of SVM:

Computationally intensive for large datasets.
Sensitive to feature scaling (normalization is often required).
Choosing the right kernel and hyperparameters (e.g., C, gamma) can be challenging.
Best Kernel Selection: We use the linear kernel because the dataset is large, has been successfully preprocessed, and it's not computationally expensive.

SVM as the Best Choice: SVM is ideal for handling text data, which often has non-linear relationships due to the complexity of natural language, and can efficiently manage high-dimensional datasets.

Model Persistence: We use joblib to save the model after training. This is important because training a model can take significant time, and joblib allows us to save the trained model for reuse without needing to retrain it from scratch.

Vectorization: We use TF-IDF vectorization instead of CountVectorizer because TF-IDF better handles the importance of terms in relation to the document, reducing the influence of common words.
